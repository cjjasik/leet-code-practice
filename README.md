While preparing for interviews, one of the key ways I have been assessing my own understanding and skill level is by doing LeetCode problems. 

This repository is a demonstration of those skills developed along with pseudo code used to help work through the problem.

Note: starting with Easy problems and will gradually work toward Medium and Hard problems.
